## Towards effective reproducible botnet detection methods through scientific workflow management systems

Even after nearly two decades of the creation of the first botnet, the detection and mitigation of their attacks remain one of the biggest challenges faced by researchers and cyber-security professionals. Although there are numerous studies related to botnet detection, estimate how much one method is better than another is still an open problem, mainly because of the difficulty
in comparing and reproducing such methods. This work proposes an architecture, implemented with SPARK as a high-performance data processing solution, together with VISTRAILS as a workflow management and data provenance solution, to address this comparability and reproducibility problem in a large-scale environment, as well as a tool, ProvTracker, to analyze and compare the methods
results.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ftoliveira/provtracker/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Here you can download ProvTracker and test it with the provenance captured from our workflows.



Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
